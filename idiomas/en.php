$bmc_txt="Founded in 2018, Bard Music Colombia is an International Music Festival in Cali, Colombia and Bucaramanga, Colombia, that uses the power of music to cultivate love, union, inclusion and diversity as well as to diminish discrimination, segregation, exclusion and hate. In addition, Bard Music Colombia conveys the idea that the best musical education includes direct contact with world class musicians and ready access to engaging musical performances at the highest level.

Bard Music Colombia worked closely this past year with three educational institutions in Cali: Orquesta de Siloé, Notas de Paz and Decepaz. All three organizations exist to articulate the fundamentals of music as tools for psychosocial development and the promotion of community coexistence. However, these three very similar education programs are divided by what is commonly known in Cali as “invisible borders”; strict social divisions among neighborhoods which not only limit any possible collaboration between schools but at times incite segregation and violence.

In 2018, Bard Music Colombia created a Symphony Orchestra that for the first time allowed collaboration among these three educational institutions. In addition, the students were able to learn from musicians from world renowned institutions such as Bard Conservatory, El Sistema, The Orchestra Now, Julliard School of Music, Manhattan School of Music, El Paso Symphony, Cali Conservatory and University of Bucaramanga. By providing personal access to teaching artists from numerous different backgrounds, Bard Music Colombia seeks to enable its students to explore an immense combination of career possibilities in a world of ever increasing job diversification. Our goal is to show the students that music can be a tremendous vehicle in one’s life and that it is possible to emerge as a musician on the international stage even when coming from a low socioeconomic background.

Inspired by the artistic and programmatic ideas of Bard Music Festival in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, all performances given as part of Bard Music Colombia use the exploration of the life and work of a single composer as a window into the social and historical context of that composer’s world. What music did these composers hear as they were writing their masterpieces? What world events occurred simultaneously in politics, science, visual art, and music that had an impact on the composer and their work? And what music has this composer continued to inspire in the future? For BMC, the promotion of traditional South American music is very important; in particular, South American composers who drew a strong connection to their traditional roots. Bard Music Colombia’s inaugural festival in 2018 focused and the life and work of Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla, who revolutionized traditional Tango into a form of contemporary classical composition. Our concert programs and pre-concert talks told an exciting story of this legendary South American musician by exploring music of Piazzolla’s mentors, contemporaries and those that he influenced. Our unique concert programs have the positive effect of inviting, attracting and welcoming all audiences to celebrate traditional South American Music and explore composers who brought their specific heritage to the forefront of their musical identity.

In the future we want Bard Music Colombia to be among the most forward-thinking music institutions in the world, combining a passion for immersive personalized education with world class performances and instilling artistic excitement into entire communities. As festival founders, we want to lead the way in changing the sometimes negative perception of classical music throughout the world as a non-diverse, exclusionary, pretentious and elitist art form in a beautiful human expression that has the power to bring together people who come from many different backgrounds. This is important because a festival such as Bard Music Colombia has the ability not only to vitalize student musicians, but all who are inspired by cultural collaboration and social unification

Sincerely,

Leonardo Pineda and Christopher Beroes";
$fmc_txt="The Colón Music Festival, in the small city of San Juan de Colón in the Venezuelan mountains, brought music to people who do not have easy access to live classical performance. Seventeen students from The Bard College Conservatory of Music and Longy School of Music of Bard College traveled to Venezuela for two weeks, to teach music lessons and master classes and give concerts for the community. Bard students participated in the creation of the Colón Music Festival Orchestra, with 100 young student musicians from states across Venezuela. The first Colón Music Festival reached 300 young people and large enthusiastic audiences; performances with the Venezuelan students were broadcast in Táchira state. The governor of Táchira publicly honored the Bard students as distinguished visitors for their extraordinary service in Venezuela.

Sincerely,

Leonardo Pineda ";
